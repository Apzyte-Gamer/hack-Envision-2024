Solution

This was the most stupid solution but here we go.

I looked at the rust file, but couldnt understand how to reverse the sum.txt so I went to see sum.txt and the number inside was 19 characters, so I put 19 in the input of the netcat and lo and behold it was the answer and I got the free flag!
