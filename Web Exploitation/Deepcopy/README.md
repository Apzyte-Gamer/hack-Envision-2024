Do you think you are good at node js? Here's a common mistake developers do, find it out, grab the flag ^^

This was a challenge which used the Deepcopy method from where we can print out the flag. We can see in the code that each input we pass through goes through the eval() function.

I basically created a duplicate object using deepcopy and put the flag variable in it as in the code given below

```js
const obj = {
    name: "Quark",
    details: {
    flag: flag,
  },
};  
```

I paased it through a request through this: `"newObj": "JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj));"` to the website using the method POST and when I recieved the data, I got the flag :)

`quarkCTF{sh4llow-i5_0nlY_d33P_LEVEL}`
