I am building my new minimal shell, can you test this before I complete and deploy on web.

Opening the source code files, we can see that we can only go to directories starting from `/app/files`. Going to the app, I played around a bit and noticed we can easily bypass the `/app/files` requirement by a directory bypass. So, to see in the root folder, we can put `/app/files/../..`.

Upon putting the command as `ls`, arg as `-la` and path as `/app/files/../..`, we can see the files and find `flagUTLSCS.txt`.

Now, ls lists the files or directories and grep is used to find specific keywords in a file. Thats why, to find the flag, we are going to use grep.

Since grep doesnt have any arguments such as `-la`, `-i` and `-C`, we will have to take this in our own hands. Therefore, I opened up Postman and put the URL as `https://path.ctf.teamquark.com/execute` (since the /execute endpoint manages the form), changed the method to POST and put these in the body:

I used `quarkCTF` as argument for grep since our flag starts from that.

And when I sent the request, we got our flag!
