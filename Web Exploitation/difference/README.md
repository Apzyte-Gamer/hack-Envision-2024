Looking at the code (api.py), we see the `strong_method` is 128 bits which is considered logically impossible to crack. Hence, we have to find an alternative method to bypass the `strong_method`.

The description contains `strong HTTP method`. This gives me a clue that we have to bypass the HTTP, and after lots of researching, came in front of my very eyes `X-Http-Method-Override`. I researched on this and found out how this works.

I then quickly went to Postman, put the method as b (we can put any alphanumeric character), URL as https://difference.ctf.teamquark.com/flag (since the endpoint for the flag is /flag, given in the code) and a Header as `X-Http-Method-Override: GET` and gave it a go!

And finally, we got our flag!
