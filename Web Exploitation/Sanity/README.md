Upon looking at what this app does, I started testing random URL's and it gave me the code for it. I looked at the source code and knew we had to do something with localhost but not use any of this `localhost = ['127.0.0.1', '::1', 'localhost', '0.0.0.0', '2130706433', '01111111 . 00000000 . 00000000 . 00000001']`.

I looked up how to bypass localhost and found a list of SSRF bypasses. Everything was not working except when I found `user:pass@localhost:5500`. 

By looking at the app.py file, we know the flag's gonna be in the /yay endpoint since the last few lines of code refers to that only.

Making the final URL as `http://user:pass@localhost:5000/yay`, I put it in the input and get the flag!
