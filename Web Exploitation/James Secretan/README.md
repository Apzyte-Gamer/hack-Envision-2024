Upon loading the website, I tried to simply read `flag.txt` by putting it in the input, but I get an error.

This makes me suspicious why the `index.php` file is back 4 directories. I then check the source code and find out that even the image is 4 directories back...

This makes me 90% sure that the flag is also 4 directories behind. Now, the flag can be anything absurd like flag69420.txt (nice), flag312931.txt, etc. So, I go on reading the description again.

The thing that made me most curious till now was `James Secretan`. The description also says, "Well are you a good spy?". This definetly meant `James Bond 007`. OSINT came useful hehe.

I then put the flag location as `../../../../flag/007.txt` and got a cipher `xbhyrJAM{I0uk_Qht3z_I0uk}`. I went to CyberChef and bruteforced it as ROT 13 with known phrase as `quarkCTF` and got the flag!

`quarkCTF{B0nd_Jam3s_B0nd}`
