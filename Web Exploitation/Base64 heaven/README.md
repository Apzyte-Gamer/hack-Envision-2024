Upon inspecting the site, we can't find something out of the ordinary. So, I look at the source code instead.

On looking in the source code, I find many base64 strings in picture data form. I saw many BIG BIG phrases but couldn't find anything small enough to decode until I looked at the end of `blog1.html` and found `cXVhcmtDVEZ7YjY0XzE1bnRfM25jcnlwdDEwbn0=`. I went to CyberChef and decoded this and got the flag!

`quarkCTF{b64_15nt_3ncrypt10n}`
